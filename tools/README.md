# Tools used

Throughout the class we will use a variety of tools to help us detect, decode, and exploit different data links.  Below is a running list of tools that we have/will use in the class.  

## Detection tools

  * [qspectrumanalyzer](https://github.com/xmikos/qspectrumanalyzer) - A good spectrum analyzer program that will allow you to sweep through a large chunk of the rf spectrum when paired with a HackRF. 
  *  [inspectrum](https://github.com/miek/inspectrum) - A good viewing software for looking at and cleaning up rf captures.
  * [GQRX](https://github.com/csete/gqrx) - a good generic SDR receiver for linux that will let you scan the spectrum and listen in on signals.  
  * [SDR#](https://airspy.com/download/) - A good generic SDR receiver for windows.  Originally it was made for the AirSpy, but will work on the HackRF. 


## Analysis Tools

  * [Universal Radio Hacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh) - A good tool for windows and linux to do both low level demodulation and message analysis on signals.
